# shiny-server

A repository to host external shiny apps.
The idea of this approach came from 
[Dean Attali's instructions for creating a shiny server on Digital Ocean](https://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/).

I'm not sure what he does, but my implementation will develop the app elsewhere
and then copy it here when I want to show it on that shiny server.
